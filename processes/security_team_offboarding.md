# Off-boarding Existing Security WG Members

This document aims to provide a clear process for off-boarding existing WG members due to inactivity or any other eligible reason.

## Process

Every P period of time the WG will run through a process of validating membership relevancy as follows:

* An issue will be posted on the WG Repository that will mention all existing WG members to query whether participation in the WG is still relevant.
* After 2 weeks a reminder notice will be posted
* After 4 weeks those who haven't responded to the issue will be placed in a pending status ('emeritus')
* After 4 weeks those who haven't responded to the issue will be removed from the WG (see `Revoking Access to Confidential Systems` section for details on access removal check-list)

At any time until the last time mark any member can chime in and request to retain his membership without requiring consensus reaching by the WG.

## Revoking Access to Confidential Systems

The following is a check-list for which existing WG members should be removed access from:
* [ ] Remove user from [Repo README](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/README.md), [Triage Team](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/processes/third_party_vuln_process.md), [Security Team List](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/processes/security_team_members.md), [GitHub CodeOwners](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS), 
* [ ] Remove membership from [Node.js WG Team](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/security-wg)
